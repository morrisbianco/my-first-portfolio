[Description](#Description)

My project was to create my own portfolio from scratch. On my portfolio, you will see a hero image and navigation links to the contents on my page.

Below the hero image, you will see a sidebar on the left with my profile picture and a short bio about myself. On the right, you will see two boxes with pictures of my current live applications.

Below these, you will find my footer with my contact links and copyright tag.
